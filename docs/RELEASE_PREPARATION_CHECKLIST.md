# Release Preparation Checklist for Abohlib

This document captures all the steps taken to prepare abohlib for a formal GitHub release (v1.0.0).

## 1. Code Migration and Integration
- [ ] Migrate ACID repository pattern from pipeline project
- [ ] Scan pipelib and pipeline_ada for reusable components
- [ ] Fix compilation errors (e.g., abstract type issues)
- [ ] Integrate migrated components with existing codebase

## 2. Testing and Quality Assurance
create comprehensive unit and integration tests to achieve at least 90% coverage.  Use our testing framework in abohlib for all tests. create a tests folder with the same directories as in abohlib.  Follow the naming pattern for files as abohlib and pipeline_ada.
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for all domain components
- [ ] Achieve minimum 90% test coverage on domain layer
- [ ] Fix all failing tests (e.g., ULID_Helpers test failures)
- [ ] Create test coverage report documenting coverage metrics
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass consistently

## 3. Build System and Compilation
- [ ] Fix all compilation warnings for clean builds
- [ ] Add pragma Unreferenced for unused parameters
- [ ] Remove unused imports
- [ ] Update Makefile with proper commands:
  - [ ] Add build-dev command (with --development flag)
  - [ ] Add build-release command (with --release flag)
  - [ ] Ensure alphabetical ordering in help text
- [ ] Test all build configurations work correctly

## 4. Documentation Generation
- [ ] Update README.md with comprehensive examples and architecture overview
- [ ] Create Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- [ ] Create Software Design Document (SDD)
- [ ] Create Software Test Plan (STP)
- [ ] Generate UML architecture diagrams:
  - [ ] Package structure diagram
  - [ ] Domain model class diagram
  - [ ] Repository pattern class diagram
  - [ ] Pipeline processing sequence diagram
  - [ ] Saga coordinator activity diagram
  - [ ] Component dependencies diagram
  - [ ] Deployment diagram
- [ ] Generate SVG files from PlantUML diagrams
- [ ] Create multi-language porting guide for Go/Rust
- [ ] Consolidate redundant documentation files
- [ ] Target documentation for junior engineers (without explicitly mentioning)

## 5. Version Management
- [ ] Update version in alire.toml to 1.0.0
- [ ] Update version in abohlib_config.ads
- [ ] Update version in project files
- [ ] Ensure version consistency across all files

## 6. Pre-Release Verification
- [ ] Run full CI pipeline locally (make ci)
- [ ] Verify clean build with make build-release
- [ ] Run all tests with make test
- [ ] Check documentation builds correctly
- [ ] Verify no uncommitted changes

## 7. Git Release Process
- [ ] Commit all changes with descriptive message
- [ ] Create annotated git tag (v1.0.0)
- [ ] Push tag to GitHub
- [ ] Create GitHub release with:
  - [ ] Comprehensive release notes
  - [ ] Key features summary
  - [ ] Installation instructions
  - [ ] Links to documentation
  - [ ] Quality metrics
  - [ ] Quick start examples

## Additional Tasks Performed

### Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed Result package naming issues
- Renamed Duration field conflicts (to Elapsed_Time)
- Fixed method call errors (Unwrap to Get_Ok/Get_Err)
- Removed problematic pragma Preelaborate
- Enhanced ULID timestamp extraction logic
- Fixed string validation in ULID_Helpers

### Documentation Artifacts Created
- `/docs/SOFTWARE_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md`
- `/docs/SOFTWARE_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md`
- `/docs/SOFTWARE_TEST_PLAN.md`
- `/docs/UML_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md`
- `/docs/MULTI_LANGUAGE_PORTING_GUIDE.md`
- `/docs/diagrams/` (SVG files)
- `/tests/TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md`

### Architecture Patterns Documented
- Hybrid Architecture (DDD + Clean + Hexagonal)
- Dependency Inversion Principle
- Repository pattern with ACID guarantees
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Result pattern for error handling
- Type-safe IDs using phantom types
- Value objects with self-validation

## Commands for Future Releases

### Build and Test
```bash
make build-dev      # Development build with debugging symbols
make build-release  # Optimized release build
make test          # Run all tests
make test-coverage # Run tests with coverage analysis
make ci            # Run full CI pipeline
```

### Release Commands
```bash
# Update version in files
# alire.toml, abohlib_config.ads

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for v1.0.0 release"

# Create and push tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0 - Description"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Create GitHub release
gh release create v1.0.0 --title "v1.0.0 - Title" --notes "Release notes"
```

## Time-Saving Tips
1. Use `make ci` to run all quality checks at once
2. Keep CLAUDE.md updated with project-specific instructions
3. Use TodoWrite tool to track complex multi-step processes
4. Run tests frequently during development
5. Generate documentation as code changes, not just at release
6. Use semantic versioning consistently
7. Maintain clean git history with meaningful commits
